    This website is about web design created by Camden Gugel as a student
    project for ARTD-245 at North Central College. All text comes from Dribbble or Flux Academy
    articles, linked at the bottom of each page. All images were created by me using Photoshop, from the original articles, or free Adobe stock images.
      The website has been created using HTML and CSS in PyCharm.
